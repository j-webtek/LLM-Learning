### Stories

- **[New data poisoning tool lets artists fight back against generative AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai/)**:
    - Analysis: Nightshade is a new tool developed by a team led by Ben Zhao from the University of Chicago that allows artists to fight against AI companies using their work without permission. The tool adds invisible changes to the pixels in an artist's work, causing AI models trained on scraped data to produce incorrect and unpredictable outputs. This can damage image-generating AI models and disrupt their ability to generate accurate results. The tool, currently submitted for peer review, aims to tip the power balance in favor of artists and protect their copyright and intellectual property. The team also developed Glaze, a tool that allows artists to mask their personal style to prevent it from being scraped by AI companies. Nightshade will be integrated into Glaze, and both tools will be open source, allowing others to use and modify them.

- **[Show HN: Autolicious – AI-powered bookmark cataloging Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autolicious/jbmpomloomhbfflncpmcmfajbppfddjk)**:
    - Analysis: Autolicious is a Google Chrome extension that automatically organizes bookmarks using ChatGPT and the OpenAI API. With just one button press, users can add bookmarks and the extension will automatically categorize them with a category, sub-category, and description. However, it's important to note that users will be charged for requests made to the GPT API by OpenAI, with prices starting from $0.0015 per bookmark added.

To use the extension, users need to provide their OpenAI API key, which can be obtained by registering with OpenAI and creating an API key. The extension's popup window allows users to enter their API key and save the settings.

It's important to consider privacy and security concerns when using this extension, as it sends the page content to the OpenAI API for categorization. Although OpenAI claims to handle user data securely, users who have concerns about privacy and the security of their browsing history may want to avoid using this extension.

This version of Autolicious is still in its early stages and only supports viewing saved bookmarks, without the ability to manually organize them.

- **[The Beatles: 'final' song Now and Then to be released thanks to AI technology](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/26/the-beatles-final-song-now-and-then-ai-technology)**:
    - Analysis: The long-awaited "final" Beatles song, titled "Now and Then," is set to be released thanks to AI technology used to enhance the audio in Peter Jackson's documentary, "Get Back." The software was used to separate John Lennon's vocals from a demo tape he left to Paul McCartney. The song was written and sung by Lennon in the late 1970s and was given to McCartney by Yoko Ono in 1994. Technological limitations at the time prevented the vocals and piano from being separated and added to new parts recorded by the other three Beatles. However, using AI-assisted software, the original audio from footage of the Beatles recording their final album, "Let It Be," was de-mixed and isolated for the documentary. This technology was then used to isolate Lennon's vocals and piano for "Now and Then," and McCartney and Ringo Starr have contributed new parts to the song, with George Harrison's guitar parts from 1995 also included.
